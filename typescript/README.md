# Installations and project starter kits

## Node project starter kit

First of all create a new folder or open an empty folder (select name for folder without space) in the VS CODE. Then open a new terminal and run.

**Note (For windows users): By default the terminal profile in the VS code is set to _powershell_. In window powershell has n't much permissions to run typescript compiler. So kindly shift to command prompt or cmd.**

    `npm init`

or

    `npm init -y`

If you are running the first command it will ask you some questions for now ust press enter and go with default values. And the second command will do it automatically for you and after running the command you will get a `package.json` file.
